# jarversion
Java version is a tool that identifies the version of the JDK the jar file was built in. 

# How to use the class?
`String jarFileLocation = "\\path\\to\\jarfile\\jarchecker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"; 
System.out.println("JDK Version used to compile is "+JarChecker.getJavaVersion(jarFileLocation));`

Replace the jarFileLocation with the path to your file name.
